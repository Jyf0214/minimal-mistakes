# The layout for Treehole page 
---

<p>The page is served as a microblog space, where I would like to publish some short and simple contents, such as "what I'm doing" or "what's my feeling today".</p>
    
<p>Instead of embedding the microblog system into <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, I simply adopt the <a href="https://giscus.app/">Giscus</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/discussions">GitHub Discussions</a> framework, so I can easily manage those short posts (and I don't need to write too many codes). Besides, I lift the comment restriction so that other users (if there are) can publish posts as well.</p> 
    
<p>Feel free to leave your messages here.</p>
