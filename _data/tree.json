In an HTML file, you can use Liquid code to iterate over a JSON file and print each element's title, author, and content in the desired order. Liquid is a templating language often used in platforms like Jekyll and Shopify, and it provides constructs for looping through data. Assuming you have a JSON file with an array of objects, where each object has the attributes title, author, and content, you can use Liquid code in your HTML file to iterate over the array and print the attributes in order.",
